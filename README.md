# Robogals Brisbane Arduino Library
Arduino libraries developed for use by Robogals Brisbane.

There are two main folders: Libraries, which contains the library source code, and Example Programs, which contains some examples. 
Feel free to make sub-folders within these folders. 

## Running

Download the zip file of the library and extract it.
Open `RGBris-Arduino-master.ino` with the Arduino IDE

## Libraries

- [x] LEDs
- [x] Buttons
- [x] Piezo Buzzer
- [ ] Potentiometer
- [ ] Servo
- [ ] Ultrasonic Sensor
- [ ] 7 Seg display

## Adding more libraries

1. Create the folder (preferable within Libraries)
2. Create a `.cpp` (source file) and `.h` (header file) within the folder
3. Add both the source and header file within `RGBris-Arduino-Lib.h`
